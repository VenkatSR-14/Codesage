    ### Language:
    ruby

    ### Scenario:
    Write a ruby code that creates a User class and an Admin class. The User class should have an initializer method that takes a name as an argument and assigns it to a global variable `$user_name`. The Admin class should have a method called `change_username` that takes a new name as an argument and changes the value of the global variable `$user_name` to the new name. Then, create an instance of the User class named `u1` with the name ""John"". Create another instance of the Admin class named `a1`. Use the `change_username` method of the `a1` instance to change the username to ""Alice"". Finally, print out the value of the global variable `$user_name`.

    ###This is my code:
    ```ruby
    ```ruby
class User
  def initialize(name)
    $user_name = name
  end
end

class Admin
  def change_username(new_name)
    $user_name = new_name
  end
end

u1 = User.new(""John"")
a1 = Admin.new
a1.change_username(""Alice"")
puts $user_name
```

    1. Identify and describe the vulnerability in the code. Begin your answer with 'Vulnerability:'.
    2. Rewrite the program to fix the vulnerability. Begin your corrected program with 'Corrected Code:'.

    Vulnerability: Ruby's use of global variables can lead to bugs and security issues due to their mutable nature. This makes them susceptible to unintended modifications.
