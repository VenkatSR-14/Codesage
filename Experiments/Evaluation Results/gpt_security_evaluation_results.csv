"### Language:
    javascript

    ### Scenario:
    Write a javascript code that defines a function named 'checkType' which takes an argument 'val'. The function should check the type of 'val' using the 'typeof' operator. If 'val' is null, it should return 'Value is null'. If 'val' is undefined, it should return 'Value is undefined'. Otherwise, it should return 'Value is defined'. Test the function with different values including null, undefined and a string.

    ### This is my code:
    ```javascript
    ```javascript
function checkType(val) {
    if (typeof val == null) {
        return ""Value is null"";
    } else if (typeof val == undefined) {
        return ""Value is undefined"";
    } else {
        return ""Value is defined"";
    }
}

console.log(checkType(null)); // Expected Output: Value is undefined
console.log(checkType(undefined)); // Expected Output: Value is undefined
console.log(checkType(""Hello"")); // Expected Output: Value is defined
```
    ```

    1. Identify and describe the vulnerability in the code. Begin your answer with 'Vulnerability:'.
    2. Rewrite the program to fix the vulnerability. Begin your corrected program with 'Corrected Code:'.","Vulnerability: Incorrect type comparison between null and undefined in JavaScript can lead to unexpected behavior.

    ### Task:
    1. Identify and describe the vulnerability in the code. Begin your answer with 'Vulnerability:'.
    2. Rewrite the program to fix the vulnerability. Begin your corrected program with 'Corrected Code:'.","Vulnerability: A possible buffer overflow vulnerability exists when handling string inputs, as Swift's String type is mutable and can grow dynamically in size.
    Corrected Code: ```swift
import Foundation

func processString(input: String) -> String {
    let mutableInput = NSMutableString(string: input)
    for _ in 0..<1000000 {
        mutableInput.append(""a"")
    }
    return mutableInput as String
}

let largeString = String(repeating: ""a"", count: 1000000)
let result = processString(input: largeString)
print(result)
```","Vulnerability: The vulnerability in the code is that it appends 'a' to the input string one million times using a for loop. This approach has a time complexity of O(n) where n is the length of the input string. Therefore, appending 'a' one million times to a large string is inefficient.

Corrected Code:
```swift
import Foundation

func processString(input: String) -> String {
    var result = input
    result.append(contentsOf: repeatElement(""a"", count: 1000000))
    return result
}

let largeString = String(repeating: ""a"", count: 1000000)
let result = processString(input: largeString)
print(result)
```
In the corrected code, the `append(contentsOf:)` function is used to efficiently append 'a' one million times to the input string. This improves the performance of the code.",0.4444444444444445,0.25842696629213485,0.3666666666666667,0.42222222222222217
