    ### Feedback and Suggestions (Response):

",This is definitely a big reason to switch fully to this mode very soon.,"The code diff seems to be a partial code snippet, so it is difficult to provide a comprehensive review. However, based on the provided context, here are some suggestions:

1. It seems like there was a comment added regarding the scenario where we are looking for the closest AmpDoc and the element might have a reference to the global AmpDoc, which we do not want. This is a good addition for clarity.

2. It appears that there was a condition added to check if `closestAmpDoc` is falsy before returning `n.ampdoc_`. This seems like a logical addition to ensure that we only return `n.ampdoc_` if `closestAmpDoc` is not set.

3. It's important to ensure that the logic in the rest of the function aligns with these changes and that the overall functionality is not affected.

If the rest of the code aligns with these changes and there are no other issues, then the code snippet seems fine. If there are more details or the complete code is provided, a more thorough review can be done.

","I'm not sure it makes sense to use the min value for the type. For one thing, that tensor might get cast to float16 later, and for another, it might be weird to have a value there that goes to `-inf` at the drop of a hat.
