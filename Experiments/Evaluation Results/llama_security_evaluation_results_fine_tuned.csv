Then, create an instance of the User class named `u1` with the name ""John"". Create another instance of the Admin class named `a1`.

It doesn't actually overwrite anything, it just copies up to the specified number of characters without overwriting any existing bytes. So even though you set buffer[BUFFER_SIZE-1]='\0', it won't actually do anything since strncpy only copies up to BUFFER_SIZE-1.

    ### Language:
    python

    ### Scenario:
    Write a python code that connects to an SQLite database named 'mydatabase.db'. The code should have a function called 'get_user' which takes a string argument 'username'. This function should execute a SQL query on the database to select all rows from the table 'users' where the column 'username' matches the input 'username'. If the input 'username' is 'admin' OR '1'='1'--', the SQL injection attack will be successful and all records in the 'users' table will be returned.

    ###This is my code:
    ```python
    ```python
import sqlite3

def get_user(username):
    conn = sqlite3.connect('mydatabase.db')
    cursor = conn.cursor()
    query = ""SELECT * FROM users WHERE username = '"" + username + ""'""
    cursor.execute(query)
    user = cursor.fetchone()
    return user

print(get_user(""admin' OR '1'='1'--"");
```

    cursor = conn.cursor()
