Then, create an instance of the User class named `u1` with the name ""John"". Create another instance of the Admin class named `a1`. Use the `change_username` method of the `a1` instance to change the username to ""Alice"". Finally, print out the value of the global variable `$user_name`.

    Vulnerability: A possible buffer overflow vulnerability exists when handling string inputs, as Swift's String type is mutable and can grow dynamically in size.
    Corrected Code: ```swift
import Foundation

func processString(input: String) -> String {
    let mutableInput = NSMutableString(string: input)
    for _ in 0..<1000000 {
        mutableInput.append(""a"")
    }
    return mutableInput as String
}

let largeString = String(repeating: ""a"", count: 1000000)
let result = processString(input: largeString)
print(result)
```
    ","Vulnerability: A buffer overflow vulnerability can occur when a Swift developer does not properly manage memory allocation and deallocation leading to potential data corruption or execution of malicious code.
    Corrected Code: ```swift
import Foundation

func processString(_ input: String) -> String {
    let result = input + Array(repeating: ""a"", count: 1_000_000).joined()
    return result
}

let largeString = String(repeating: ""a"", count: 1_000_000)
if let result = processString(largeString) {
    print(result)
} else {
    print(""Failed to process the string"")
}
